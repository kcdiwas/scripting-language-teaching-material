# Object Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Create and Access Student Object
Create an object called `student` with these properties:
* `name`: "Alice"
* `grade`: 85
* `subject`: "Math"

Then:
1. Show the student's name
2. Add a new property `passed` with value `true`
3. Change the grade to 90
4. Show all the information

**Expected output:**
```
Alice
name: Alice, grade: 90, subject: Math, passed: true
```

**Hint:** Use dot notation to access and modify properties!

## Problem 2: Using Square Brackets
Create an object called `car`:
```js
let car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  model: "Camry",
  year: 2020
};
```

Then:
1. Use a variable `key` set to `"brand"` to access the brand using square brackets
2. Add a property with spaces: `"fuel type"` with value `"gasoline"` (use square brackets)
3. Access and show the `"fuel type"` property
4. Remove the `year` property using `delete`

**Expected output:**
```
Toyota
gasoline
brand: Toyota, model: Camry, fuel type: gasoline
```

**Hint:** Remember, square brackets work with variables and property names with spaces!

## Problem 3: Property Shorthand and Computed Properties
Create a function called `createProduct` that takes two parameters: `name` and `price`.

The function should return an object using:
1. Property shorthand for `name` and `price`
2. A computed property `[name + "Id"]` with value `name.length * 100`

**Test it with:**
```js
let product = createProduct("Laptop", 999);
alert(product.name);
alert(product.price);
alert(product.LaptopId);
```

**Expected output:**
```
Laptop
999
600
```

**Hint:** Property shorthand means `name` instead of `name: name`. Computed properties use `[expression]`!

---

## Problem 4: Check Property Existence
Create an object:
```js
let user = {
  username: "john_doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  active: true
};
```

Then check:
1. Does `"email"` exist? Use the `in` operator
2. Does `"age"` exist? Use the `in` operator
3. What happens if you try to access `user.phone`? Show the result
4. Add a property `phone` with value `undefined`
5. Check if `phone` exists using `in` operator (even though value is undefined)

**Expected output:**
```
true
false
undefined
true
```

**Hint:** The `in` operator checks if a property exists, even if its value is `undefined`!

---

## Problem 5: Loop Through Object Properties
Create an object:
```js
let inventory = {
  apples: 50,
  bananas: 30,
  oranges: 25,
  grapes: 40
};
```

Write code to:
1. Loop through all properties using `for..in`
2. For each property, show: "We have [quantity] [item]"
3. Calculate and show the total number of all items

**Expected output:**
```
We have 50 apples
We have 30 bananas
We have 25 oranges
We have 40 grapes
Total: 145
```

**Hint:** Use `for (let key in object)` to loop, then access values with `object[key]`!

---

## Bonus Challenge
Create an object called `library` with books:
```js
let library = {
  "book1": "JavaScript Guide",
  "book2": "Python Basics",
  "book3": "Web Development"
};
```

Then:
1. Use a loop to show all book titles
2. Add a new book "book4" with title "Data Structures"
3. Check if "book2" exists before trying to access it
4. Create a new object `libraryCopy` by looping through `library` and copying all properties

**Expected output:**
```
JavaScript Guide
Python Basics
Web Development
Data Structures
book2 exists: true
libraryCopy has: book1, book2, book3, book4
```

**Hint:** You can copy properties by looping and setting them in a new object!
