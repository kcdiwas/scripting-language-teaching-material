# Objects

JavaScript has eight types of data. Seven of them are simple types that hold just one value, like numbers or text.

Objects are different. They let you store multiple pieces of information together. Think of an object like a box with labeled drawers. Each drawer has a name (called a "key") and you can put anything inside it (the "value").

You'll use objects everywhere in JavaScript, so it's important to understand them well!

## Creating Objects

You can make an empty object in two ways:

```js
let user = new Object(); // one way
let user = {};  // easier way (most people use this)
```

The second way with curly braces `{}` is simpler and more common. This is called an "object literal".

## Adding Information to Objects

Let's create an object with some information:

```js
let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // key "name" has value "John"
  age: 30        // key "age" has value 30
};
```

Each piece of information is called a "property". A property has:
* A key (the label, like "name")
* A value (what's stored, like "John")

The colon `:` separates the key from the value. Commas separate different properties.

You can read the information using the dot:

```js
alert( user.name ); // John
alert( user.age );  // 30
```

You can add new properties anytime:

```js
user.isAdmin = true; // add a new property
```

You can remove properties with `delete`:

```js
delete user.age; // remove the age property
```

## Property Names with Spaces

What if you want a property name with spaces? Like "likes birds"? You need to use quotes:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true  // must use quotes for spaces
};
```

But wait, you can't access it with a dot! JavaScript gets confused:

```js
user.likes birds = true; // ERROR! This doesn't work
```

For property names with spaces, you need square brackets:

```js
// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

The square brackets can hold any string, even with spaces or special characters.

## Using Variables as Property Names

Here's something cool: you can use a variable to access properties:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let key = "name";
alert( user[key] ); // John (reads user["name"])
```

This doesn't work with dots:

```js
let key = "name";
alert( user.key ); // undefined (looks for property named "key", not "name")
```

Square brackets are powerful because they let you use variables or calculate property names. But they're longer to type. So most people use dots when possible, and switch to brackets when needed.

## Computed Properties

You can even use variables when creating an object:

```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, // property name comes from the variable
};

alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if user entered "apple"
```

The square brackets `[fruit]` mean "use the value of this variable as the property name". This is called a "computed property".

You can use expressions too:

```js
let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // becomes "appleComputers": 5
};
```

## Property Shorthand

If you have a variable and want to create a property with the same name, you can use a shortcut:

```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,  // normal way
    age: age
  };
}
```

You can write it shorter:

```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name,  // same as name: name
    age    // same as age: age
  };
}
```

Both work the same! The shorthand saves typing when the property name matches the variable name.

## Property Name Rules

For variables, you can't use reserved words like "for", "let", or "return". But for object properties, you can use any name!

```js
let obj = {
  for: 1,
  let: 2,
  return: 3
};

alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return ); // 6 (this works!)
```

Property names can be almost anything. If you use a number, JavaScript converts it to text:

```js
let obj = {
  0: "test" // same as "0": "test"
};

alert( obj["0"] ); // test
alert( obj[0] );   // test (same thing)
```

## Checking if a Property Exists

One cool thing about JavaScript: you can try to read any property, even if it doesn't exist! You won't get an error, just `undefined`:

```js
let user = {};

alert( user.noSuchProperty ); // undefined (no error!)
```

You can check if a property exists by comparing to `undefined`:

```js
let user = {};

alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means it doesn't exist
```

There's also a special `in` operator:

```js
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

alert( "age" in user );    // true, it exists
alert( "blabla" in user ); // false, it doesn't exist
```

You can use a variable with `in`:

```js
let user = { age: 30 };
let key = "age";
alert( key in user ); // true (checks if "age" exists)
```

Why use `in` instead of checking `undefined`? Sometimes a property exists but its value is `undefined`:

```js
let obj = {
  test: undefined // property exists, but value is undefined
};

alert( obj.test );        // undefined (looks like it doesn't exist)
alert( "test" in obj );   // true (property DOES exist!)
```

This is rare, but `in` is more accurate in these cases.

## Looping Through Objects

To see all properties in an object, use a `for..in` loop:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  alert( key );        // shows: name, age, isAdmin
  alert( user[key] );  // shows: John, 30, true
}
```

This loop goes through each property one by one. You can use any variable name instead of `key`:

```js
for (let prop in user) {
  // same thing, just different name
}
```

## Are Objects Ordered?

When you loop through an object, what order do properties appear in? It's a bit complicated!

**Short answer:** Properties that look like whole numbers get sorted. Other properties stay in the order you added them.

Here's an example:

```js
let codes = {
  "49": "Germany",
  "41": "Switzerland",
  "44": "Great Britain",
  "1": "USA"
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49 (sorted!)
}
```

The numbers get sorted! So USA (1) comes first, even though you added it last.

But if your property names aren't numbers, they stay in the order you added them:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};
user.age = 25; // add another

for (let prop in user) {
  alert( prop ); // name, surname, age (in order added)
}
```

If you need properties to stay in a specific order, make sure the names aren't pure numbers. You could add a plus sign:

```js
let codes = {
  "+49": "Germany",
  "+41": "Switzerland",
  "+44": "Great Britain",
  "+1": "USA"
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert( code ); // "+49", "+41", "+44", "+1" (in order added)
}
```

Now they stay in the order you write them!

## Quick Recap

Objects store information in key-value pairs (like labeled drawers).

**Creating objects:**
```js
let obj = {}; // empty
let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // with properties
```

**Accessing properties:**
* Dot notation: `obj.name`
* Square brackets: `obj["name"]` or `obj[variable]`

**Working with properties:**
* Add: `obj.newProp = value`
* Remove: `delete obj.prop`
* Check if exists: `"prop" in obj`

**Looping:**
* `for (let key in obj)` to see all properties

**Remember:** Objects are everywhere in JavaScript! Arrays, dates, and many other things are actually objects too, just with special features. We'll learn more about those later.

Objects are powerful tools. This is just the beginning!
