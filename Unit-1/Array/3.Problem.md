# Array Methods Practice

## Exercise 1: Fix and Insert with splice
Start with this array:
```js
let words = ["I", "study", "JavaScript", "now"];
```
Tasks:
1. Remove "study"
2. Replace "now" with "everyday"
3. Insert "hard" and "daily" after "JavaScript" without removing anything
4. Show the final array

Expected output:
```
I,JavaScript,hard,daily,everyday
```

Hint: Use splice three times. In step 3 use deleteCount = 0.

## Exercise 2: Copy Parts with slice and concat
Start with:
```js
let nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];
```
Tasks:
1. Make a new array that contains only 20, 30, 40
2. Make another array that contains the last two numbers
3. Concatenate both new arrays into one

Expected output:
```
20,30,40
50,60
20,30,40,50,60
```

Hint: slice does not modify the original; concat returns a new array.

---

## Exercise 3: Search and Count
Given:
```js
let items = ["pen", "book", "pen", "bag", "pen", "pad"];
```
Tasks:
1. Find the first index of "pen"
2. Check whether "bag" exists in the array
3. Count how many times "pen" appears (use a loop or reduce)

Expected output:
```
0
true
3
```

Hint: includes checks presence. indexOf gives the first position. For counting, compare each item to "pen".

---

## Exercise 4: Map, Sort, Reverse
Given:
```js
let names = ["Zara", "alex", "Mike", "bob"];
```
Tasks:
1. Create a new array of uppercase names
2. Sort the uppercase array alphabetically using default sort
3. Reverse the sorted array
4. Show all three arrays (original, sorted, reversed)

Expected output (shape):
```
Zara,alex,Mike,bob
ALEX,BOB,MIKE,ZARA
ZARA,MIKE,BOB,ALEX
```

Hint: Use map with toUpperCase(), then sort(), then reverse().

---

## Exercise 5: Split, Join, and Reduce
Given the string:
```js
let csv = "12, 7, 5, 10, 6";
```
Tasks:
1. Split it into an array of strings by comma and space
2. Map to numbers
3. Calculate the sum using reduce (initial value 0)
4. Join the numbers back into a string separated by "-"

Expected output:
```
40
12-7-5-10-6
```

Hint: Use split(', ') then Number(x) in map. Always pass an initial value to reduce.
