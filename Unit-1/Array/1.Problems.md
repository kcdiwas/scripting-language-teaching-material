## Problem 3: Loop Through Scores
You have an array of test scores: `[85, 92, 78, 90, 88]`.

Write code to:
1. Loop through all scores using `for..of`
2. Show each score with a message like "Score: 85"

**Expected output:**
```
Score: 85
Score: 92
Score: 78
Score: 90
Score: 88
Total: 433
```

**Hint:** Create a variable to keep track of the total as you loop!

## Bonus Challenge
Create a multidimensional array representing a tic-tac-toe board:

```js
let board = [
  ["X", "O", "X"],
  ["O", "X", "O"],
  ["X", "O", "X"]
];
```

Access and show:
1. The center piece (middle row, middle column)
2. The top-left corner
3. The bottom-right corner

**Expected output:**
```
X
X
X
```

**Hint:** Use two sets of square brackets like `board[row][column]`!
