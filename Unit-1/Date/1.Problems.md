# Date and Time Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Create and Display Dates
Create three different date objects:

1. Current date and time
2. Your birthday (use year, month, day - remember month starts at 0!)
3. A date from the string "2024-12-25"

Then:
* Show each date
* Show the day of the week for your birthday (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)
* Show the month name for your birthday (hint: create an array of month names and use `getMonth()`)

**Expected output format:**
```
Current date: [current date]
Birthday: [your birthday]
Christmas 2024: [date]
Day of week: [number]
Month: [month name]
```

**Hint:** Remember months start at 0! January is 0, December is 11.

## Problem 2: Date Calculations
Create a date for January 15, 2024:

```js
let date = new Date(2024, 0, 15);
```

Then:
1. Add 30 days to this date
2. Add 2 months to this date
3. Set the time to exactly noon (12:00:00)
4. Show the final date and time

**Expected output:**
```
After adding 30 days: [date]
After adding 2 months: [date]
At noon: [date with 12:00:00]
```

**Hint:** Use `setDate()` and `setMonth()` with addition. JavaScript will automatically handle month boundaries!

## Problem 3: Time Difference Calculator
Create two dates:
* Start: March 1, 2024 at 9:00 AM
* End: March 5, 2024 at 3:30 PM

Calculate and show:
1. The difference in milliseconds
2. The difference in seconds
3. The difference in minutes
4. The difference in hours
5. The difference in days

**Expected output:**
```
Difference in milliseconds: [number]
Difference in seconds: [number]
Difference in minutes: [number]
Difference in hours: [number]
Difference in days: [number]
```

**Hint:** Subtract the dates to get milliseconds, then divide by 1000 for seconds, 60000 for minutes, 3600000 for hours, and 86400000 for days!

## Bonus Challenge
Create a function called `getAge` that takes a birth date and returns the person's age in years.

**Test it with:**
```js
let birthDate = new Date(2000, 5, 15); // June 15, 2000
let age = getAge(birthDate);
alert(`Age: ${age} years`);
```

**Expected output:**
```
Age: [current age] years
```

**Hint:** Get the current year and birth year, subtract them. But also check if the birthday has passed this year!
