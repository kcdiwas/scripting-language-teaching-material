# Function Expression Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Converting to Function Expression
Take this Function Declaration and convert it to a Function Expression. Then copy it to another variable and test that both work!

**Starting code:**
```js
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}
```

**Your task:**
1. Convert this to a Function Expression (store in a variable called `double`)
2. Copy the function to a new variable called `timesTwo`
3. Test both by calling them with the number 5

**Expected output:**
- `double(5)` should return `10`
- `timesTwo(5)` should also return `10`

**Hint:** Remember the semicolon at the end of Function Expressions!

## Problem 2: Build Your Own Callback System
Create a function called `calculate` that takes three parameters:
- `num1` (a number)
- `num2` (a number)  
- `operation` (a function that does something with the two numbers)

Then test it with different operations!

**Test it with:**
```js
// Test 1: Add the numbers
calculate(10, 5, function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
});

// Test 2: Multiply the numbers
calculate(10, 5, function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
});

// Test 3: Subtract them
calculate(10, 5, function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
});
```

**Expected output:**
- First call should return: `15`
- Second call should return: `50`
- Third call should return: `5`

**Hint:** Your `calculate` function should call the `operation` function and pass it `num1` and `num2`!

## Problem 3: Fix the Broken Code!
This code doesn't work. Can you fix it using what you learned about Function Expressions and scope?

**Broken code:**
```js
let time = prompt("Enter time (morning/evening):");

if (time === "morning") {
  function greet() {
    alert("Good morning!");
  }
} else {
  function greet() {
    alert("Good evening!");
  }
}

greet(); // ERROR! greet is not defined
```

**Your task:** Fix this code so `greet()` works outside the if/else blocks.

**Expected behavior:**
- If user types "morning" → alert shows "Good morning!"
- If user types "evening" → alert shows "Good evening!"

**Hint:** You need to declare a variable outside the if/else, then use Function Expressions inside the blocks!

## Bonus Challenge
Predict what this code will output. Will it work or will it break? Why?

```js
// Code A
sayHello();

function sayHello() {
  alert("Hello from Declaration!");
}
```

```js
// Code B  
sayGoodbye();

let sayGoodbye = function() {
  alert("Goodbye from Expression!");
};
```

**Questions:**
1. Will Code A work? Why or why not?
2. Will Code B work? Why or why not?
3. What's the key difference?
