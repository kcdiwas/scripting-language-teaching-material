# Function Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Greeting Machine
Create a function called `greet` that takes a person's name as a parameter and shows an alert saying "Welcome, [name]!".

**Test it with:**
```js
greet("Sarah");
greet("Mike");
```

**Expected output:**
- First call should alert: "Welcome, Sarah!"
- Second call should alert: "Welcome, Mike!"

---

## Problem 2: Calculator Function
Write a function called `multiply` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their product (multiply them together). Then call it a few times and show the results.

**Test it with:**
```js
let result1 = multiply(5, 3);
let result2 = multiply(10, 4);
alert(result1);
alert(result2);
```

**Expected output:**
- First alert should show: 15
- Second alert should show: 40

## Problem 3: Variable Scope Challenge
Look at this code and predict what will be alerted. Then test it to see if you're right!

```js
let score = 100;

function updateScore() {
  score = 150;
  alert("Inside function: " + score);
}

alert("Before function: " + score);
updateScore();
alert("After function: " + score);
```

**Question:** What will each alert show and why?

**Why?**

## Problem 4: Default Parameter Practice
Create a function called `makeAnnouncement` that takes two parameters:
- `title` (required)
- `subtitle` (optional, with a default value of "No additional info")

The function should alert: "[title] - [subtitle]"

**Test it with:**
```js
makeAnnouncement("Breaking News", "Markets are up!");
makeAnnouncement("Weather Update");
```

**Expected output:**
- First call: "Breaking News - Markets are up!"
- Second call: "Weather Update - No additional info"

## Problem 5: Local vs Outer Variables
What will this code output? Try to figure it out before running it!

```js
let playerName = "Alice";

function startGame() {
  let playerName = "Bob";
  alert("Player in game: " + playerName);
}

alert("Player before game: " + playerName);
startGame();
alert("Player after game: " + playerName);
```

**Question:** What does each alert show?


**Why?**

## Bonus Challenge ðŸŒŸ
Create a function called `fullGreeting` that takes three parameters:
- `firstName` (required)
- `lastName` (optional, default: "Guest")
- `timeOfDay` (optional, default: "day")

The function should alert: "Good [timeOfDay], [firstName] [lastName]!"

**Test cases:**
```js
fullGreeting("John", "Doe", "morning");
fullGreeting("Jane", "Smith");
fullGreeting("Bob");
```

**Expected output:**
- "Good morning, John Doe!"
- "Good day, Jane Smith!"
- "Good day, Bob Guest!"
